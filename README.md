### Hi there, I'm Alice ðŸ‘‹

I am an undergraduate student at UBC majoring in Computer Science :seedling:

You can reach me via [email](mailto:aliceykim0828@gmail.com?Subject=Hi%20there!) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/yehee). To check out a list of projects that I've been working on: [yehee.github.io](https://yehee.github.io)

I am interested in web development :computer: and UI design :cat2: . I spent the last 3 weeks of summer working on [**pik**](https://akhl.me), a social media platform to share photos and get a summary of your posts based on tags like people or food. I also worked on a React web app called [**ThinkSmall**](https://github.com/CPSC436/ThinkSmall) over the summer. I am actively working on [**nwHacks2021**](https://nwhacks.io) @ nwPlus and [**Life @ UBC**](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/life-at-ubc) project at UBC LaunchPad.
